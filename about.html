        <h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
        <p>
            I like to go indoor rock climbing or bouldering in other terms. I like to stay active since most of my time I spend around sitting on a computer
            either learning code or just watching anime or shows. I don't go as often as I like to due to work scheduling but its a good where to have fun 
            and still be able to get a work out in. Plus its fun when you have friends join in too, as it not only helps motivates one another to push past 
            our limits but time flies when you're tring to beat your firends in a little climbing competition.

        <h2>Korean BBQ</h2>
        <p>
            Korean BBQ/ KBBQ is always my go to when someone ask where I want to eat. Though some people may not like the aspect of cooking your own food that
            you pay for. I for myself enjoy that aspect, since for one I love cooking in general so I'm always the one in my friend group cooking whenever we 
            all go out. Another reason why I like KBBQ so much is because the social setting. Its like having a home cooked meal with all your friends without
            actually being at home. Also its all you can eat so if I'm gonna pay about $30 to $40 for food might as well get all you can eat.

        <h2>3D Modeling/ Animation</h2>
        <p>
            Ever since middle school I always wanted to get into the video game industry and create cool video games when I got older, which is why I started learning
            3D modeling and 3D animation. I am by no means an expert but whenever I free time I like to just creat models or design concept art on an application called
            "Blender". One day I'd like to incorperate both my knowledge of 3D modeling and coding into a small indie game that I create in the future soon.
